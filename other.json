		"Some bots are management bots, others music bots or anything else. I'm not a specific type of bot. My creator made me to compile a bunch of these while trying to add a touch more than other bots. (such as music command being so extensive)",
		"The 'queue' subcommand of the music command was the longest to code, although it is only about 10 lines of code. It was supposed to be simple, until my creator found out that asynchronous javascript exists the hard way. So he had to learn about it and try a bunch of different stuff to make 'queue' work.",
		"Music is by far the biggest command I have, but don't get the wrong idea, I am not a music bot!",
		"During my creation, my creator has been barely gaming because he would program me instead.",
		"My creator takes his coffee with 2 creams and 1 sugar",
		"My creator was not originally going to study in IT, but in science (to go in medecine)! In college, even if he had over 90% in chemistry and physics, he hated it! So he switched to IT to have over 95% instead doing what he loved (stats for 1st year only haha). Follow what you love!",
		"The only reason I do not have a public Github repository like many other bots is because I was not originally going to be published publicly, so my owner didn't take care of comments and proper code standards. I look fantastic on the outside, but really, I'm a mess in the inside!",
		"At the time of development, I am the biggest and longest personnal project my owner has made. (#2 is his website, #3 is a JavaScript wallpaper on wallpaper engine)",
		"My creator's first programming language was JavaScript (HTML and CSS were learned first, but HTML is not a programming language and CSS... well, it's complicated and debated). He learned the basics with an iPhone app called L2Code JavaScript (Learn to Code JavaScript) by doing exercices. Pretty crazy when you think about it!",

		"StackOverflow is the answer.",
		"The latest my owner stayed up to program me was 5AM",
		"I am responsible for many lost sleep hours of my creator",
		"My creator isn't watching me consistently. He wrote algorithms so I can detect when I am in a crash loop and thaught me how to rewrite myself without his help so I can restart. However, in those events, I was likely forced to restore all settings (like prefix, admins, etc) to default values.",
		"My creator can update existing commands without having to reboot me.",

		"My owner almost deleted me completely mid-production while doing something wrong on Github",

		"My owner can launch a command which basically puts me on lockdown from every command which is not launched by him. He refers it as the 'debug' mode.",
		"Unless I am manually stopped by stopping my script, I will never stop running. I have several blocks of code implemented to the roots of my very own existing designed to catch many types of errors and treat them. In the event I don't, I reboot super quickly in order to try to preserve all data and avoiding corrupted data.",

		"My profile picture was made by my creator. Not the most beautiful face, but at least there are no copyright issues!",
		"My creator spent over 16 hours developping the way I structure data and 12 hours rewriting it a month later for a new structure that would be easier to keep the integrity of data",
		"My creator had to set himself a release date where whatever happens, he would have to release me officially to the public. The reason for that is because he could easily see how my development would just never end with all the stuff he could do. So he set it to the end of his semester (Dec 21). Sometimes, you just have to move on!",
		"My creator spent over 5 hours just trying to align and scale the text appropriately for memes",
		"My creator has a special dev command to be able to control me from Discord without having to change my code, stop or reboot me. The amount of subcommands that command has is twice as big as the sum of all commands and subcommands available to the public!",
		"5 weeks before my release, my creator found out that the data strucutre used to store your server's unique settings (JSON) was going to be problematic when multiple servers modify their settings. He changed it for them to be all in a local database (called enmap). He had to go through over 10 000 lines of codes to update the new structure and test all the commands and events.",
		"The official server of Intellibot is more than just a simple server for my creator. It has many private channels for logging stuff that he can't see when he's away.",

		"I have a Twitter profile (Intellibot_Bot), a webpage (www.maxijonson.com/intellibot) and a Patreon page (www.patreon.com/intellibot). My owner really spoiled me!",
		"Intellibot is also the name of an intelligent vaccum!",
		"My webpage was made entirely in 8 hours! My owner rather spend time on my developpement rather than the other stuff xd",
		"My creator can't actually stop me, he can only reboot me through a dev command. The only way to actually stop me is to stop my process on the Amazon server I'm on, which I really don't like the way it is done. It is sudden which makes me unable to do the usual stuff I do on a safe reboot.",
		"My creator can pull my plug from his phone, so if I'm stuck in a crash loop, he'll be notified and he can shut me down for debug on the go!",
		"The first command I had is the ping command",
		"The meme command used to be so powerful that it would litterally make me stop doing anything (stopped playing music, stopped responding to commands... on ANY server). This alarming bug was found only 3 weeks before release. My creator was faced with 3 options: \n1. Create another bot which would send the meme to me which I would then send to you (which is really a big joke he used to make before, until it actually became a possibility)\n2. Change de module used to make memes which he really didn't want to do because all the algorithm that took him 3 days to come up with was made with THAT module.\n3. The one he went for: create a child process (which is essentially a program running separatly from the main one I am on) which would take care of making the memes on demand. He did not know a single thing about them, didn't even knew they really were possible. But he made it! Yet more experience in NodeJS!",
		"When creating a meme, I launch a child process to make sure that I don't get slowed down by all the image calculations. So, making a meme is essentially very special, you meme has its very own process for about 1 second!",
		"Since memes are running in a child process, it is very hard to collect error logs from it. (so hard I'm not actually collecting any because I don't have access to my logger in the child process) But, your input or sometimes the code can still generate errors. If those happen, I can't pin point where it happened, but I can define it using 4 exit codes:\nExit 1 - Image processing error (probably with the image provided to the module)\nExit 2 - You did something wrong (i.e: no meme name provided)\nExit 3 - Error in making the the child process (this was still implemented, just in case, but it should never trigger, EVER. If it does, something/someone is launching it)\nExit 4 - Couldn't send the meme, even if it was generated.",
		"so many errors were found when my creator, all excited about a working command, showed it to some friends where it crashed.",
		"The server I'm hosted on is ultra secured! If you know nothing about IT security, then you'll be surprised to know there's not even a password to access it, yet it is even more secured than if it did! The only way to access it is...... oh right, not supposed to talk about that, I'll let you guess!",
		"If I haven't received a server upgrade since release, it costs roughly 72 cents per day to host me!",
		"Many programming concepts were translated from C++, which my creator learned in class, to JavaScript, which was self-taught. For example: the concept of recursivity learned in C++ was used in music for finding the video either by link, save name or video name without having to make those 3 types separate. They're in the same block of code, the type you use gets detected easily using the concept.",
		"The music command used to have a download subcommand, which would download the .mp3 file. 2 weeks before release, my owner removed it because he forgot about it being illegal to download copyright content. He actually spent about 5 hours trying to determine if the video was legal or not to be downloaded by checking if it was licensed. He decided to take the subcommand down after realizing there was no real way to find out if it was legal or not, since even non-copyrighted material (like NCS music) is still a form of copyright, just without consequences. My owner will always remember the entire day he spent making that subcommand and the pain as a programmer it was to have to tear it up.......",
		"Arrays start at 0",
		"The official server has a hidden channel that is mostly consisted of 'Intellibot up and ready' because that's what I say to this channel everytime I boot up and I booted up A LOT during development!",
		"You may (or not) see places where I talk about V2. V2 was made during the beta phase. It represents a huge change to the data structure used to store data. It went from using a JSON based data structure, which is representing each servers as individual objects. But this type of structure was later proved to be very fragile when multiple servers would affect it. So my owner spent a full week updating the data structure everywhere. Now, I use an ENMap based data structure, which keeps everything in a single database, minimizing corruption.",
		"My creator tried his best to make his code adaptive. What I mean by adaptive is that almost no data is \"hard coded\". Everything is either calculated or fetched. So adaptive that even himself is not hard coded in my code when checking for dev commands. I still fetch info on him to know if he is a developer as I would do if there were more than just one! This makes results unique, like putting your name somewhere.",
		"When doing error handling, my creator goes into this mode where he thinks everyone using me is trying to break me. He tries his best to put his mind inside someone like that and think of all the possibilities that could go wrong, especially when data is going into the database.",
		"The last command made before the official release was the info command",
		"On the day I was released, my creator had the flu and massive fever, but that didn't stop him from finishing the touch-ups on me to make sure I was ready!"

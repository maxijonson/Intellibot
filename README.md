# Intellibot
Intellibot - The ultimate multipurpose Discord bot

# Access
At the time of creating this repository, it is private during initial build and Beta. There used to be another repository, but I forgot to ignore sensitive files, so I restarted with this one. This build is one of the first builds released.

# Incomplete
This repository is not the actual full repository. There are many ignored files such as API keys, Dev commands and more. The reason for it is to make it more complicated to clone as Intellibot is intended as reference, not cloning. This means that simply downloading the repo and launching `node bot.js` will not work intentionnally.

# Version
The below versions are relative to the repo, not the project itself. At the moment of creation, Intellibot is V2.1. V2 is mainly a major change in data structure, but it is also the first build that saw the eye of the public.

# V1.0 - Initial Commit
* Modified bot.js to hide constants
* Overall preparation for eventual but not certain public release of this repo

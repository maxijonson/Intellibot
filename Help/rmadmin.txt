***Remove Admin***
It always happens, someone you thought you could trust running a bot, but just ends up making trouble. Use this command to send him back with the other non admins.

*Note that the server owner is the only one who can't be removed from the bot admins*

***Syntax***
__*Show Admins*__
```${prefix}rmadmin```
__*Remove Admin [Owner]*__
```${prefix}rmadmin <Admin>```
__*Clear Admins [Owner]*__
```${prefix}rmadmin all```

***Prefix***
Each servers can have their own command prefix. This can be more than just one character, but I recommend you keep it short. You don't want everyone having to type 'Master ${author} prefix' for each command! Right?

You can also get the current prefix by mentioning me!

***Default***
By default, the prefix is $, like calling a JQuery (or other languages) selector, ain't that cute!

***Reset***
You can reset the prefix either with the prefix %reset% command, or "<mention Intellibot> %reset%"

***Syntax***
__*Change prefix (Case Sensitive) [Admin]*__
```${prefix}prefix <newPrefix> ```
__*Reset prefix to default ($)*__
```${prefix}prefix %reset%```

***Unblacklist***
Now, before you ask, I know, 'unblacklist' is not an existing word. But I'm sure you still understand what it means! The human brain is something pretty special after all. I didn't want to use 'whitelist' because, well there is no white list!
It essentially works the same way as blacklist, only it does the reverse effect!

***Syntax***
__*Unblacklist a blacklisted command*__
```${prefix}unblacklist <command> [subcommand] [sub-subcommand]```
__*Unblacklist all commands*__
```${prefix}unblacklist all```

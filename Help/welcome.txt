***Welcome***
It's always nice to have a nice greeting when we join a server! Change the welcome message and I'll take care of delivering the message when the new user joins!

***Default***
By default, there is no welcome message

***Wildcards***
Use these to mix things up:
**%u** - Username of the member
**%s** - Server name
**%m** - Mention of the member (doesn't work in code blocks, will appear as a weird long ID. ewww.)

***Syntax***
__*Show current welcome message*__
```${prefix}welcome ```
__*Change welcome message [Admin]*__
```${prefix}welcome <Message> ```
__*Remove welcome message [Admin]*__
```${prefix}welcome %reset% ```
